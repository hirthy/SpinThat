Spin That allows you to search Spotify, Grooveshark and Rdio at the same time. It uses Spotify's metadata API, Grooveshark's Tinysong API and Rdio's Web Service API.

All results are found using php to grab and parse the json. Spotify and Rdio requests are set to get 100 results. I use jQuery to only display some of the results at a time. Grooveshark's Tinysong API should return a max of 32 results but is only showing 15 and I'm uncertain why.

Spotify can't return less than 100 results at a time. If they could return only 5 results than I would do everything through ajax calls in jQuery in order to make the search faster by getting 5 results at a time.
